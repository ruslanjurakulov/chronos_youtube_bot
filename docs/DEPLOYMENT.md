# Deployment & Go-Live Checklist

> **Status: code complete, never run live.**
> All pipeline code is written and covered by **234 passing tests**, but the
> system has **never executed against real credentials** — there have been
> **zero GitHub Actions runs**, and the required secrets/variables are not yet
> set. Nothing here is a code change; every item below is an **operator/credential
> task** the repo owner performs once to make the bot actually operate.

> **⚠️ Read this before you finish the checklist.**
> The YouTube upload in `main.py` is **UNCONDITIONAL** once a run reaches Stage 8.
> The pipeline tracks a `HUMAN_APPROVAL` stage (`modules/pipeline_stages.py`) and
> ships `tools/approve_run.py`, but **that approval gate is intentionally NOT
> wired to publishing** — `main.py` uploads regardless of whether a run was
> approved (see the comments in `main.py` around Stage 8 and the docstring of
> `tools/approve_run.py`). The only thing that stops an upload is the `--no-upload`
> flag or a missing/invalid YouTube token. **Completing this checklist means the
> daily job WILL upload real videos to your channel on its next scheduled run.**
> Be deliberate: keep `YOUTUBE_PRIVACY=private` until you have watched the first
> few outputs end to end.

## 1. Prerequisites — accounts & API keys to obtain

| # | Thing you need | Where to get it | Used for |
|---|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | **Google AI Studio — Gemini API key** | https://aistudio.google.com/apikey | Script generation, research, fact-check, comment classification (`GEMINI_MODEL = gemini-3.6-flash` in `config.py`) |
| 2 | **Pexels API key** | https://www.pexels.com/api/ | Stock HD video/image footage (`modules/media_fetcher.py`) |
| 3 | **Google Cloud project** with **YouTube Data API v3** enabled, plus an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app)** | https://console.cloud.google.com → APIs & Services → Enable "YouTube Data API v3" → Credentials → Create OAuth client ID (Desktop). For the intelligence layer also enable **YouTube Analytics API**. | Uploading videos, reading analytics, fetching comments (OAuth) |
| 4 | **YouTube Data API key** (a plain API key credential, *not* OAuth) | Same Google Cloud project → Credentials → Create credentials → API key | Public-data reads: competitor + trend polling (`modules/competitor_monitor.py`, `modules/trend_detector.py`) |
| 5 | **The target YouTube channel** (its channel ID) | Run `python main.py --list-channels` after OAuth (Section 4) | Confirms uploads target the right channel |
| 6 | *(optional)* **ElevenLabs API key** | https://elevenlabs.io | Premium TTS — only if you switch `TTS_PROVIDER` from `edge` to `elevenlabs` |
| 7 | *(optional)* **Slack incoming webhook** | https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks | "Runs pending approval" nudge (`tools/check_pending_approvals.py`) |

The OAuth **Client ID** (item 3) is downloaded as a JSON file — this becomes your
local `client_secret.json`. The OAuth **token** (`youtube_token.json`) is *not*
downloaded; you mint it once locally in Section 4.

---

## 2. GitHub Actions secrets & variables

Set these under **repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Secrets go
on the **Secrets** tab; `COMPETITOR_CHANNEL_IDS` is a **Variable** (Variables tab),
because the workflow reads it as `${{ vars.* }}`, not `${{ secrets.* }}`.

Every name below is referenced verbatim by a workflow file — nothing here is
invented.

### Secrets

| Secret name | Used by workflow(s) | Required? | How to get it |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | `daily_video.yml`, `intelligence_poll.yml` | **Required** | Google AI Studio key (Prereq 1) |
| `PEXELS_API_KEY` | `daily_video.yml` | **Required** | Pexels key (Prereq 2) |
| `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_JSON` | `daily_video.yml`, `intelligence_poll.yml` | **Required** | Full contents of `client_secret.json` (OAuth Desktop client, Prereq 3). Both workflows write it back to disk unconditionally. |
| `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON` | `daily_video.yml`, `intelligence_poll.yml` | **Required to publish** (workflows guard on it: without it the upload/analytics/comment steps fail, since headless CI cannot run the OAuth browser consent) | Full contents of the `youtube_token.json` you mint locally in Section 4 |
| `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` | `daily_video.yml`, `intelligence_poll.yml` | Recommended (code defaults to empty → uploads to the account's default channel; when set, the uploader verifies it belongs to your account — `modules/youtube_uploader.py._verify_channel`) | `python main.py --list-channels` (Prereq 5) |
| `YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY` | `intelligence_poll.yml` | Optional — intelligence layer degrades gracefully without it (competitor/trend passes read empty and skip) | Google Cloud API key (Prereq 4) |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | `daily_video.yml` | Optional — the daily workflow hardcodes `TTS_PROVIDER=edge`, so this is unused unless you change that | ElevenLabs (Prereq 6) |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | `check_pending_approvals.yml` | Optional — the notifier always logs; Slack is only attempted when set (`modules/notifier.py`) | Slack incoming webhook (Prereq 7) |

### Variables

| Variable name | Used by workflow | Required? | How to get it |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| `COMPETITOR_CHANNEL_IDS` | `intelligence_poll.yml` (`${{ vars.COMPETITOR_CHANNEL_IDS }}`) | Optional | Comma-separated channel IDs, e.g. `UCxxxx,UCyyyy`. Empty → no competitors polled. |

> **Note on `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`:** because `daily_video.yml` sets
> `TTS_PROVIDER: edge` inline, Edge TTS (free) is used and no ElevenLabs key is
> needed for the default configuration. Set the secret only if you also change
> `TTS_PROVIDER` to `elevenlabs`.

## 3. One-time OAuth consent — minting `youtube_token.json`

The uploader (`modules/youtube_uploader.py`), the comment fetcher
(`modules/comment_fetcher.py`), and the analytics client
(`modules/analytics_client.py`) all authenticate the same way: they read the
OAuth token file at `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_FILE`; if it is missing/invalid and no refresh
is possible, they fall back to `InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(...)`
and `flow.run_local_server(port=0)` — i.e. **a browser consent screen**. That
browser step **cannot run in GitHub Actions**, so you must generate the token
**once, locally**, and store it as a secret.

**Steps (run on your own machine, one time):**

1. Put the OAuth client JSON from Google Cloud (Prereq 3) at the repo root as
   `client_secret.json` (or point `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` at it in `.env`).
2. Populate a local `.env` from `.env.example` (at minimum `GEMINI_API_KEY`,
   `PEXELS_API_KEY`; set `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` once you know it).
3. Run a command that triggers auth. The simplest is listing channels:
   ```bash
   python main.py --list-channels
   ```
   A browser window opens → sign in with the Google account that owns the target
   channel → grant the requested scopes (upload, readonly, yt-analytics readonly —
   see `YOUTUBE_SCOPES` in `config.py`). On success the token is written to disk.
4. Copy the printed channel ID into `.env` as `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` (and into the
   `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` GitHub secret).

**Where the token lands (important filename gotcha):**
`config.py` builds the token path as
`youtube_token{_channel_suffix}.json`, where the suffix is `_<YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID>`
**when `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` is set**, and empty otherwise. So:

- If you ran the consent step **with `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` set**, the file is
  `youtube_token_<channelid>.json`.
- If you ran it **without** it set, the file is `youtube_token.json`.

The workflows write the `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON` secret back to **`youtube_token.json`
(unsuffixed)**. In CI the workflows also set `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID`, so `config.py`
will look for `youtube_token_<channelid>.json` and **not find** the unsuffixed
file. Two safe ways to avoid a silent auth failure in Actions:

- **Recommended:** mint the token **without** `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` set locally so
  the credentials themselves are channel-agnostic (the token content is the same
  either way — it identifies the Google account, not the file name). The token
  *content* you store as `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON` is what matters; store the JSON body
  of whichever `youtube_token*.json` file was produced.
- Then verify locally that a run with `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` set in `.env` still
  authenticates using that token content before relying on CI. If it re-prompts
  for consent, the token file name is being missed — align the names.

**Store the two files as secrets (raw JSON, not base64):**
The workflows restore them with a plain `echo '...' > file` (no `base64 -d`), so
paste the **raw file contents**:

- `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_JSON` ← entire contents of `client_secret.json`
- `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON`         ← entire contents of your `youtube_token*.json`

`tools/setup_check.py --reveal` prints exactly these values ready to paste
(terminal-only) under a "GitHub Secrets" heading — a convenient way to copy them.

---

## 4. Optional / intelligence-layer configuration

The intelligence poll (`tools/run_intelligence_poll.py`, run by
`intelligence_poll.yml`) is built to **degrade gracefully** — each pass is
independently defensive, so a missing key or empty list skips that pass rather
than failing the run.

| Config | What it unlocks | Behavior when absent |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY` | Competitor monitoring + trending-video detection (public-data reads) | Those passes read with an empty key and skip; comment/analytics passes (OAuth) unaffected |
| `COMPETITOR_CHANNEL_IDS` (Actions **variable**) | Polls the named channels for competitive signal | Empty string → zero competitors polled (`_competitor_channel_ids()` returns `[]`) |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack "runs pending approval" nudge from `check_pending_approvals.yml` | Notifier still logs to stdout/log; Slack simply not attempted |
| `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` / `TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs` | Premium ElevenLabs narration | Defaults to free Edge TTS |

The whole intelligence layer is optional for *publishing*: the daily video job
does not depend on it. It exists to feed the content-planning queue that
`TopicManager` consumes before spending a Gemini call.

---

## 5. Dry-run & verification (test without publishing)

Do these in order before letting the daily job publish.

1. **Local preflight** — tells you exactly what's still missing:
   ```bash
   python tools/setup_check.py
   ```
   Fix every `FAIL` row (requires `ffmpeg`, `imagemagick`, fonts, and the Python
   deps from `requirements.txt`). Exit code 0 = local runs possible.

2. **Local full pipeline, no upload** — proves generation works end to end and
   writes a real `.mp4` to `output/<slug>/` without touching YouTube:
   ```bash
   python main.py --niche "history mysteries" --no-upload
   ```
   (`--no-upload` sets `skip_upload=True`, so Stage 8 is skipped entirely.)

3. **Verify Actions secrets with a non-publishing workflow first.** In GitHub →
   Actions, `workflow_dispatch`-trigger **Intelligence Poll** (`intelligence_poll.yml`).
   It **never uploads** — it only reads analytics/competitors/trends and comments —
   so it's a safe way to confirm `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_JSON`,
   `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON`, `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID`, and `YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY` are all
   valid in the CI environment. Check the run log for auth warnings (e.g.
   "CommentFetcher auth failed", "IntelligencePoller failed") — those indicate a
   bad or missing token before any publish is at stake.

4. **Optional: dispatch the daily job privately.** You can `workflow_dispatch`
   **Daily YouTube Video** with `privacy: private` to do a real but unlisted-to-you
   upload as a final smoke test, then delete the test video. Remember: any dispatch
   of this workflow *does* upload.

---

## 6. Go-live

1. Confirm all **Required** secrets from Section 2 are set, and the token/secret
   filename caveat from Section 3 is resolved (Intelligence Poll ran clean in
   Section 5, step 3).
2. Ensure the **Daily YouTube Video** workflow is enabled (Actions tab — GitHub
   auto-disables schedules on repos with no recent activity; a manual dispatch or
   an enable click reactivates it). Its cron is `0 15 * * *` (15:00 UTC daily,
   defined in `daily_video.yml`).
3. Understand the trigger: **the first real, automatic upload happens on the next
   15:00 UTC cron tick.** With the publish gate intentionally not enforced, that
   run *will* publish. Keep `YOUTUBE_PRIVACY=private` (the default, and the
   workflow's default dispatch input) until you've reviewed several outputs, then
   switch to `unlisted`/`public` deliberately via the dispatch input or by
   changing the default.
4. The other schedules come along for free once secrets are set: Intelligence Poll
   at `0 20 * * *`, and Check Pending Approvals every 6 hours (`0 */6 * * *`).

## 7. Open items — critical path (P0 / P1)

All operator/credential tasks. **No code changes are required to go live.**

**P0 — blocking any real run:**
- [ ] Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (secret) — Prereq 1.
- [ ] Set `PEXELS_API_KEY` (secret) — Prereq 2.
- [ ] Create Google Cloud project, enable YouTube Data API v3 (+ Analytics API),
      create OAuth Desktop client → store contents as `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_JSON`.
- [ ] Run local OAuth consent once → mint `youtube_token.json` → store contents as
      `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_JSON` (Section 3).
- [ ] Resolve the token **filename suffix** caveat (Section 3) so CI actually
      finds the token when `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` is set.

**P1 — needed for correct/complete operation:**
- [ ] Set `YOUTUBE_CHANNEL_ID` (secret) so uploads are verified against the
      intended channel rather than the account default.
- [ ] Run `python tools/setup_check.py` locally and clear all `FAIL` rows.
- [ ] Dry-run `main.py --no-upload` locally (Section 5, step 2).
- [ ] `workflow_dispatch` **Intelligence Poll** and confirm no auth warnings
      (Section 5, step 3) before enabling the daily publish.
- [ ] Set `YOUTUBE_DATA_API_KEY` (secret) to enable competitor/trend polling.
- [ ] Decide and set final `YOUTUBE_PRIVACY` posture; confirm the Daily schedule
      is enabled (Section 6).

**P2 — optional enhancements:**
- [ ] Set `COMPETITOR_CHANNEL_IDS` (Actions **variable**) to feed competitor signal.
- [ ] Set `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (secret) for approval-pending nudges.
- [ ] Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` + `TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs` only if you want
      premium narration instead of free Edge TTS.
