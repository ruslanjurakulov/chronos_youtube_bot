"""Performance Analyzer — turns captured post-publication metrics history
into actual analysis.

Context
-------
A prior implementation report found that "post-publication performance
analysis" was capture without analysis: `modules/intelligence_poller.py`'s
`poll_own_channel_metrics()` writes rows into `StateStore`'s
`metrics_snapshots` table, but nothing anywhere read that history back and
turned it into any insight — no averages, no "what performed well," nothing.
This module is that missing read side: `PerformanceAnalyzer` pulls
`StateStore.list_videos()` and, for each video, its `latest_metrics()`
snapshot, and turns the pair into ranked, explainable `VideoPerformance`
records.

The `views_per_day` metric and its "as-of" date
-------------------------------------------------
`views_per_day` is deliberately computed as
`latest_views / days_between(published_at, snapshot_date)` — using the date
the metrics were actually *measured* (`latest_metrics()`'s `snapshot_date`),
not "today" (`datetime.now()`). Two reasons:

1. Correctness: the poller's cadence can lag behind "now" (a video might not
   have been re-polled in days). Dividing by elapsed time since the last
   actual measurement gives the true average rate as of that measurement;
   dividing by time since "now" would silently understate the rate for any
   video whose latest snapshot is stale, without that staleness being
   visible anywhere in the number.
2. Determinism/testability: it makes the computation a pure function of
   persisted data, not of wall-clock time at analysis time — the same
   database always produces the same `views_per_day` no matter when
   `analyze_videos()` is called.

Day-zero smoothing
--------------------
A video whose metrics were captured on the same calendar day it was
published has zero elapsed days, which would divide by zero. Rather than
special-case that video out of the ranking (it may well be a real early
signal worth surfacing), the elapsed-days denominator is floored at 1. This
is a deliberate smoothing, not a claim that the video has genuinely been
live for a full day — treat `views_per_day` for a same-day video as "views
so far," not a stable per-day rate; it will typically fall once more days
of denominator accrue in later snapshots.

Honesty-preserving framing
-----------------------------
`analyze_videos_as_prompt_text()` follows the same posture as
`modules/topic_recommender.py`'s `suggest_topics_as_prompt_text()` and
`modules/script_engine.py`'s `_format_research_notes()`: the numbers
rendered are real (persisted metrics, not invented), but the text is
explicit that this is past-performance context to consider, not a formula
whoever reads the prompt (Gemini, a human) must follow. What made one video
perform well is never guaranteed to transfer to the next topic, and this
module does not claim otherwise.

Dependency injection
---------------------
`PerformanceAnalyzer.__init__(state_store=None)` mirrors
`TopicRecommender`: `state_store` defaults to constructing a real
`StateStore()`, wrapped in try/except so a construction failure (e.g. no
writable DB path) logs a warning and degrades to `self.state_store = None`
rather than raising. Every public method is defensive end-to-end after
that: any state-store failure is logged as a warning and degrades to the
method's documented empty/zero value (`[]` or `0.0` or `""`), never
propagates.

Wiring this into `main.py` / `modules/topic_manager.py` /
`modules/intelligence_poller.py` so it actually informs a real run is a
deliberate follow-up done by hand elsewhere, NOT part of this module — same
split as `topic_recommender.py`'s relationship to `topic_manager.py`.
