"""Topic Recommender — reads persisted intelligence data back out and turns
it into ranked, explainable topic suggestions.

Context
-------
A prior audit found the "continuous intelligence" system was built but its
feedback loop was never closed: `modules/content_opportunity.py`'s
`ContentOpportunityEngine` (fully built, well tested) had zero callers, and
the trend/competitor/demand data `modules/intelligence_poller.py` computes
was being persisted via `modules/state_store.py` and then never read back.
This module is the missing read side: `TopicRecommender.suggest_topics()`
pulls the three persisted tables (`trending_snapshots`, `competitor_snapshots`,
`demand_signals`) back out of `StateStore` and feeds them through
`ContentOpportunityEngine.rank()` to produce ranked, explainable topic
candidates.

Combining trending + competitor snapshots
------------------------------------------
`ContentOpportunityEngine.rank()` takes a single `trend_snapshots` list.
Both `trending_snapshots` (YouTube's trending feed) and `competitor_snapshots`
(specific channels this bot tracks) are, at heart, the same kind of signal:
"a video that is getting real attention on YouTube right now," just sourced
differently — one from the platform-wide trending feed, the other from
targeted competitor polling. Both `StateStore.list_trending_snapshots()` and
`StateStore.list_competitor_snapshots()` return rows with the `video_id`,
`title`, `view_count`, `published_at` shape `ContentOpportunityEngine`
documents as its `trend_snapshots` input, so concatenating the two lists is
a direct, adapter-free way to let the engine score both sources on one
consistent basis, and the ranked output's `rationale` explains *why* each
entry scored the way it did regardless of which table it came from.

Wiring this into `topic_manager.pick_topic()` — the actual "close the loop"
step — is a deliberate follow-up done by hand elsewhere, NOT part of this
module. This module only makes the read-and-rank capability exist and work
correctly in isolation.

Defensive posture
------------------
This is meant to sit next to Gemini topic generation as *inspiration*, never
as a hard dependency. In practice the underlying tables will very often be
empty (the scheduled poller that populates them has no confirmed successful
run yet), and even once it does run, a state-store construction/query
failure must never be able to take down topic selection. So every entry
point here is defensive end-to-end: any failure anywhere in the read/rank
path is logged as a warning and degrades to `[]` (or `""` for the prompt-text
variant) rather than raising — the same posture as
`modules/topic_manager.py`'s `_safe_originality_check` and
`modules/intelligence_poller.py`'s per-sub-call try/except.
