"""Fact-Checking Engine — independent second pass over a script's claims.

*** ADVISORY ONLY — THIS ENGINE DOES NOT, AND MUST NEVER, REPLACE THE HUMAN ***
*** APPROVAL GATE.                                                          ***

This project's pipeline is:

    Topic -> Research -> Script -> Fact Check -> Final Human Approval -> Publish

This module implements the "Fact Check" stage. Its entire job is to FEED the
Final Human Approval stage with an independent, machine-generated opinion on
each claim so a human reviewer has something concrete to check. It has no
authority to approve, clear, or wave a script through to publish, and nothing
in this codebase should ever be wired to skip Final Human Approval based on
this engine's output alone — no matter how confident every verdict looks.

Concretely, that shows up in the code as three defaults that always err
toward "make a human look at this":

  1. Every claim whose verdict is not the highest-confidence
     "likely_accurate" defaults `requires_human_review=True`. This flag is
     never taken from the model's own output — it is always computed here,
     from the validated verdict, so a model cannot talk its way past review.
  2. Any verdict string the model returns that isn't one of the three known
     values is clamped down to "unverifiable" (never silently treated as
     "likely_accurate").
  3. Any parsing failure, malformed JSON, or a batch that can't be resolved
     even after a retry produces the safe-default sentinel:
     verdict="unverifiable", requires_human_review=True. It never defaults to
     "accurate" just because the model's response couldn't be understood.

Input contract
--------------
`fact_check_claims` takes a plain `list[str]` of claim strings. This is a
deliberate, loose-coupling choice: this module does not import any claim
dataclass or extraction logic from another module (e.g. a future
`research_engine` or `script_engine` claim-extraction helper), since those may
live on sibling branches that don't exist in this checkout. Wiring this engine
into the rest of the pipeline — extracting claims out of a generated script,
and gating the Final Human Approval UI on these results — is a follow-up, not
part of this module.

FACT_CHECK_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an independent fact-checking assistant reviewing claims that will be
shown to a human reviewer before anything is published. You are NOT the final
decision-maker — a human always reviews your output afterward. Your job is to
give your best independent assessment of each claim's likely factual accuracy,
plus a brief, concrete reason.

For EACH claim, decide one of exactly three verdicts:
  "likely_accurate"   — you are confident the claim is factually correct.
  "likely_inaccurate" — you believe the claim is false, misleading, or
                         exaggerated.
  "unverifiable"       — you cannot confidently assess the claim (too vague,
                         no reliable way to check, contradictory evidence,
                         outside your knowledge, etc.). Use this whenever you
                         are not confident — do not guess "likely_accurate".

Input is a JSON object: {"claims": ["claim text 0", "claim text 1", ...]}
where the array index of each claim is its identity.

Return ONLY a JSON object with this EXACT schema, with one entry per input
claim, using the SAME index as the input array (0-based) — every index from 0
to N-1 must appear exactly once, where N is the number of input claims:

{
  "results": [
    {"index": 0, "verdict": "likely_accurate", "reasoning": "Brief reason."},
    {"index": 1, "verdict": "unverifiable", "reasoning": "Brief reason."}
  ]
}

Do not omit any index. Do not add extra indices. Do not merge claims. Do not
wrap the JSON in markdown code fences.
