"""Feedback Engine — closes the intelligence loop.

Context
-------
The implementation report's headline finding was that the feedback loop was
*not closed*: `intelligence_poller.py` captured own-channel metrics into
`StateStore`, and `performance_analyzer.py` could read them back, but nothing
turned that history into a persistent, structured verdict that future topic
selection actually consumed. Prompt-time context (see
`performance_analyzer.analyze_videos_as_prompt_text`) helped, but it was
recomputed and thrown away each run — there was no stored learning signal and
no per-topic score that survived between runs.

This module is the missing link:

    published video metrics (StateStore.metrics_snapshots)
        -> compare each video to the channel's own average
        -> emit discrete learning signals   (feedback_signals table)
        -> roll them up into a per-topic score with an explainable reason
                                            (topic_performance table)
        -> Topic Manager reads those scores when choosing what to make next

`FeedbackEngine.run()` executes that whole chain and persists the result;
`topic_scores_as_prompt_text()` renders the learned scores for Topic Manager
to fold into its selection prompt. The loop therefore *executes*, it does not
merely draw a diagram.

Real data only
--------------
Every number here comes from a real persisted metrics snapshot. Signals and
scores are derived by comparing a video (or topic) to *this channel's own
average*, never to an invented benchmark. Dimensions the stored metrics don't
contain (CTR, impressions, subscribers gained — YouTube Analytics can supply
them but the current capture path does not) are simply not scored, rather than
faked. A retention signal uses `average_view_duration_seconds` as the honest
proxy the schema actually stores.

Below two videos with metrics there is no meaningful "channel average" to
compare against (a lone video would be compared to itself), so `run()` records
nothing and reports `topics_scored: 0` rather than inventing a verdict.

Defensive
---------
`FeedbackEngine(state_store=None)` constructs a real `StateStore`, wrapped in
try/except so a construction failure degrades to no-op (`run()` returns zeros,
`topic_scores_as_prompt_text()` returns "") rather than raising. Every
per-video read and per-write is individually guarded so one bad row can't abort
the analysis of the rest.
