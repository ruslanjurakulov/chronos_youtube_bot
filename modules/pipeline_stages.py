"""Pipeline stage state machine — structural enforcement of the approval chain.

This module encodes, as executable state, the project's non-negotiable rule:

    Topic -> Research -> Script -> Fact Check -> Human Approval -> Publish

Automation may prepare and analyze content at every stage, but the final
PUBLISH transition is an irreversible, real-world action (an upload to
YouTube). This state machine makes it structurally impossible to reach
PUBLISH without both (a) passing through every earlier stage in order, and
(b) an explicit, separately-recorded human approval. Sequence order alone
is never sufficient to reach PUBLISH — see `advance()` below.

PERSISTENCE NOTE: This module uses its own minimal JSON-file store
(`PipelineStateMachine`) as a placeholder. A sibling in-progress module,
`state_store`, is expected to provide a more robust shared persistence layer
for the whole pipeline. Once `state_store` merges, this class's storage
should be replaced with it — the public API (`start_run`, `advance`,
`approve`, `get_run`, `list_runs`) is intended to remain stable across that
swap. Deliberately NOT imported here since it does not yet exist on this
branch.
