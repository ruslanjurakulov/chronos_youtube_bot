"""Credential health check — run it BEFORE a scheduled run spends anything.

A run costs Gemini calls, a Pexels quota, TTS characters and (at the end) a
YouTube upload. If a key is missing, the honest place to find out is the top of
the run, not three paid stages in. This gathers a single, safe-to-log report of
which credentials a run needs and whether they are present, so a scheduler can
skip a doomed run and a human can see exactly what to fix.

What it does NOT do
-------------------
* It never prints a secret — only presence/absence and our own detail strings.
* It never makes a network call — presence here means "a key is configured",
  not "the key is valid" (verify_voice already does the one live TTS probe; a
  live check of every service would itself cost quota). An unknown is reported
  as unknown, never as a pass.
* It is advisory by default: it reports and emits an event; whether a run aborts
  on a missing credential is the caller's decision, exactly as the pipeline
  already tolerates a missing publish token by skipping the upload.
