"""Per-channel spend ceiling — a hard stop that protects real money.

The cost ledger already records what a run spent (modules/cost_ledger.py). This
turns that history into a guard: a channel may set a spend ceiling, and a run
that would push the channel over it does not start. Off by default — a channel
with no ceiling behaves exactly as before.

Two honest rules:

* **Never block on missing data.** USD is known only for priced units; a run
  whose costs are all unpriced has an UNKNOWN spend, and unknown never blocks
  (that would stop production on a data gap). The status flags `has_unpriced`
  so the operator knows the number is a floor, not a ceiling.
* **A ceiling stops spending, not publishing autonomy.** It halts a run before
  it spends more; it never touches the publish gate or changes what an
  already-rendered video does.
