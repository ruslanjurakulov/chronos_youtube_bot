"""Originality / anti-repetition engine.

Today the only originality mechanism in this pipeline is TopicManager pasting
the last 80 used topics into the Gemini prompt as an exact-string exclusion
list (see modules/topic_manager.py). That catches nothing but literal repeats
of the same title — a topic that is reworded, reordered, or paraphrased sails
right through.

This module adds a real similarity check with two independent signals:

  * Semantic similarity via `model2vec` (a light, distilled static-embedding
    library — no torch/sentence-transformers needed at inference time). We
    use the `minishlab/potion-base-32M` pretrained model.
  * Lexical similarity via `rapidfuzz.fuzz.token_set_ratio`, which catches
    near-duplicate phrasing (reordered/overlapping words) that an embedding
    model can over-generalize past, or under-cluster.

Topic vectors are stored in a flat numpy .npz file rather than a vector
database — at the hundreds-to-low-thousands-of-topics scale this project
operates at, a flat file is simpler and fast enough to brute-force compare
against on every check.

Two-band thresholding: there is no universal cosine-similarity cutoff that
transfers across domains, so the engine exposes both a `hard_block_threshold`
(treat as an outright duplicate) and a lower `flag_threshold` (surface for
human review but don't auto-block). The defaults below are starting points
only — they have NOT been validated against this channel's real
back-catalogue and will need calibration once real topic history exists.

Testability: `StaticModel.from_pretrained(...)` downloads weights from
HuggingFace Hub on first use, which requires network egress this pipeline's
CI/sandbox environments may not have. The real embedding call is therefore
wrapped behind an injectable `embedder` callable (str -> np.ndarray) so unit
tests can supply a small deterministic fake instead of hitting the network.
Production code takes no action to enable this beyond passing `embedder=None`
(the default), which lazily loads the real model2vec model on first use.
