"""Provider interfaces — the seam that keeps Nightshift free of vendor lock-in.

Each capability the pipeline depends on (research, images, video clips, voice,
publishing, analytics) is expressed here as a small ``typing.Protocol``. The
concrete modules that exist today satisfy these shapes, and a future provider
(a different stock library, a different TTS, a different platform) only has to
match the shape to drop in — nothing in the pipeline needs to name the vendor.

Design notes
------------
* These are **structural** contracts (``@runtime_checkable`` Protocols), not a
  base class anyone must inherit. ``MediaFetcher`` already *is* an
  ``ImageProvider`` and a ``VideoProvider`` because it has the right methods —
  no adapter, no edit to that module. That is the point of using Protocols:
  the abstraction is additive and imposes nothing on the code it describes.
* This module holds NO API keys and makes NO network calls. It is types plus
  one thin real adapter (``GeminiResearchProvider``) around the existing
  ``research_topic`` function, whose only job is to give a module-level
  function a class shape that satisfies ``ResearchProvider``.
* Concrete adapters for voice / publishing / analytics are intentionally NOT
  written yet: ``AudioMixer``, ``YouTubeUploader`` and ``AnalyticsClient``
  carry richer constructors, and wrapping them faithfully is a follow-up. The
  contracts are defined here so that work has a target to hit.

Nothing here changes runtime behaviour; the pipeline keeps calling the concrete
modules directly until call sites are migrated behind these interfaces in a
later change.
