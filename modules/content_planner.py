"""Content Planner — a lightweight topic queue sitting *before* the real
approval pipeline even starts.

A prior audit of this project found that content planning / a content
calendar was entirely absent from the codebase: no file, no queue, no
calendar of any kind existed anywhere. This module fills that gap.

Where this sits relative to ``pipeline_stages.py``
----------------------------------------------------
``pipeline_stages.PipelineStateMachine`` enforces the *approval chain* for a
topic that has already been chosen and is being worked on: Topic -> Research
-> Script -> Fact Check -> Human Approval -> Publish. It answers "is this run
allowed to move to the next stage yet?".

This module answers a different, earlier question: "what topic should we
attempt next?" ``ContentPlanner`` is a simple FIFO queue of candidate topics
— things worth making a video about — collected from wherever they come
from (a manual add, a `ContentOpportunity` produced by
``content_opportunity.ContentOpportunityEngine``, a Gemini brainstorm pick,
etc.), each carrying a lightweight lifecycle status:
``queued`` → ``reserved`` (a run claimed it) → ``rendered`` (its video is on
disk) → ``published`` (upload succeeded), with ``skipped`` for a hard-blocked
duplicate. It is deliberately NOT a strict state machine — nothing here
*enforces* the ordering, and callers advance an entry as far as their run
actually got — just a durable list with dedup, a "give me the next thing to
work on" accessor, and honest status: a run advances an entry to ``published``
only on a real upload success, never the moment the topic is picked. Once a topic is pulled off this queue, it
is expected to be handed to ``PipelineStateMachine.start_run()`` (or
equivalent) to go through the real approval chain; wiring that hand-off up
in ``topic_manager.py`` / ``main.py`` is a deliberate follow-up and is NOT
done here (see this module's PR description).

Decoupling from ``content_opportunity.ContentOpportunity``
------------------------------------------------------------
``enqueue_opportunity()`` accepts anything duck-typed with ``.topic``,
``.source``, and ``.rationale`` attributes. It deliberately does NOT import
the real ``ContentOpportunity`` dataclass, to avoid a hard dependency on a
sibling module the same way ``content_opportunity.py`` itself avoids
importing its own siblings' dataclasses (``VideoSnapshot``, ``DemandSignal``,
etc.) and instead works off plain dicts. This keeps the two modules
mergeable independently regardless of merge order.

Dedup scope — exact-string, queued-only (NOT semantic)
----------------------------------------------------------
``enqueue()`` refuses to create a second ``"queued"`` entry for a topic
string that already has a ``"queued"`` entry, using plain exact string
equality. This is intentionally NOT semantic/near-duplicate detection —
catching "The Fall of Rome" vs. "Rome's Collapse" as the same topic is a
job for ``modules/originality_engine.py``, which already does semantic
similarity checking via model2vec. That module needs a model load and
(depending on configuration) network access; making a topic *queue insert*
depend on that is a deliberate choice NOT made here. Wiring
``originality_engine`` in as a stronger pre-enqueue (or pre-publish) check
is an explicit follow-up, not part of this module.

Dedup only ever considers *currently-queued* entries, never
``"published"`` or ``"skipped"`` ones — a topic that was already published
(or skipped) must remain re-enqueue-able later (e.g. a yearly recurring
topic, or a topic worth retrying after being skipped for an unrelated
reason). Blocking re-enqueue forever after a single publish/skip is
explicitly NOT the intent.

PERSISTENCE NOTE: like ``pipeline_stages.py``, this module uses its own
minimal JSON-file store as a deliberate placeholder, not a new
``state_store`` table. Simple write-through (read on each call, write on
each mutation) is plenty at this project's scale. If/when the shared
``state_store`` module needs to take over storage duties project-wide, this
class's persistence can be swapped out behind its stable public API
(``enqueue``, ``enqueue_opportunity``, ``next_topic``, ``mark_published``,
``mark_skipped``, ``list_entries``) — mirroring the same swap already
flagged in ``pipeline_stages.py``.
