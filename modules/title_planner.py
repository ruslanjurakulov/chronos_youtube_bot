"""Title-and-thumbnail planning — decide the promise BEFORE writing the script.

A YouTube video lives or dies on its title and thumbnail: they are what earns
the click, and everything after is retention. The pipeline used to write the
script first and derive a title from it — the tail wagging the dog. This plans
the title and a thumbnail concept up front, from the topic, so the script is
then written to *deliver on that exact promise* rather than to summarize itself.

Degrade-safe by design
-----------------------
``plan_titles`` takes an optional ``gen`` callable (``(prompt, system) -> str``)
so it can use the same Gemini client the script engine uses — but it never
depends on it. With no ``gen``, or if the model fails or returns unusable text,
it falls back to a small set of formula titles built from the topic. It never
raises into the pipeline: a title plan that can't reach the model still returns
a usable plan, and the run continues. This mirrors the rest of the codebase —
research, series, avatar all degrade rather than stop the line.
