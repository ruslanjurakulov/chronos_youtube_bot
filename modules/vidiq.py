"""vidIQ research & scoring — advisory keyword/title intelligence.

Scope, stated up front
----------------------
vidIQ is used here for **research and scoring only** — never as a second content
pipeline. This module turns vidIQ-shaped data (keyword volume/competition,
title scores) into a ranked recommendation for a human or the topic/title
planner to *consult*. Like `modules/niche_rpm.py` and `modules/publish_score.py`
it INFORMS; it never selects a topic, edits a title, or gates a publish on its
own. The pipeline's own generators stay exactly as they are.

The tested core is pure
-----------------------
The ranking heuristics (`opportunity_score`, `rank_keywords`, `rank_titles`)
operate on plain values, so they are fully unit-testable and deterministic, and
they hold the project's data honesty rules: an unknown metric is `None`, never a
fabricated `0`, and a keyword whose opportunity can't be computed is left out of
the ranking rather than ranked as the worst.

Fetching is a seam
------------------
`VidIQClient` is a Protocol so the fetch transport is injected. `VidIQResearcher`
is off unless given a client (a `VIDIQ_ACCESS_TOKEN`-backed HTTP adapter, or an
MCP-backed one) — with no client every method is a safe no-op, so an
unconfigured deployment behaves exactly as before. Wiring a concrete transport
is a deliberate follow-up, mirroring how the other advisory modules shipped
their decision layer first.
